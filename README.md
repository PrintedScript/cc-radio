# cc-radio
#### This is still a little project I spent some time on and I will not be providing any future support
Stream audio from a radio proxy into Minecraft with computercraft speakers

# Usage

## Server
For server you need to have ffmpeg installed, then in the file go to line 10 and replace the default URL with whatever radio station you want to proxy ( or you can not change it and will listen to minecraft songs)

## Client
Upload the file to pastebin, change the server url to your server ip.
> Note: the `/ws` is needed at the end of the url
